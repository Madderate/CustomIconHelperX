# CustomShortcutHelperX

If you have trouble pinning your custom shortcut to Launcher dynamically, try this library!

## What's this library for?

Sometimes we need to change shortcuts dynamically via our code.

But in China, there are so many Launchers, which run on different ROMs, so that we need to adapt
each of them to put our customized shortcuts on every Launchers.

Also, there are some differences between older and newer Android System, which is also annoying.
What I want to do is to provide a common method to pin the custom shortcut onto the Launcher, and
developers no need to care about the inner implementation, just as the XCompat Classes do.
